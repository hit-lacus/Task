# Xiaoxiang's Work and Knowledge Base

From 2021, I am going to use github to track personal task/goal and write as my notebooks. 

- Repo [Work-KB](https://github.com/hit-lacus/Work-KB/issues) is aim to public-visable task management and knowledge base.
- Repo [PrivateNote](https://github.com/hit-lacus/PrivateNote/issues) is aim to private affairs.

To get a bird's eye view into how everything is going on, I am going to use Zenhub's workspace to combine multi repos ( refer to [multi-repo workspace](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010346-creating-a-multi-repo-workspace) ) .

### My practice

- Project

A project to track a long-term goal (last for about half or several year).

- Epic

A epic contains some task which are for the same **subject** . 

- Issue

A issue is to record a piece of **knowledge base article** or a **single task**.

- Checklist

N/A

- Milestone

Milestone is optional, I am not good at estimate, to be honest.
